# Embedded-Controller 2
<b>Short description:</b><br/>
In this project I want to work with Embedded-Controller 2. part, where it's a bit more advanced. I have a case task that is about an office environment, where
I need to do certain task with my Controller. <br/>
<b>The Libraries I used for my project:</b> <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os.git">mbed-os 6.2.0</a> <br/>
<a href="https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/code/BSP_DISCO_F746NG/">BSP_DISCO_F746NG</a> <br/>

<h5>String</h5>

<b>Functionality:</b><br/>
In the office 
I need to write out which office the Controller is placed, I need to get an accurate tempature the office has. If the office is too cold I was thinking of 
a blue diode will turn on and a message will be shown on the touchscreen saying, the office is to cold. If the room is too hot a buzzer plays a sound and a red 
diode will light up with a text saying the room is too hot. After a few seconds the buzzer will shut down.In the evening if a high pitch noise happens, 
the buzzer will play a high pitch sound. If I want to shut down the buzzer I need to press a button twice. I will use C++ for the programming language.
