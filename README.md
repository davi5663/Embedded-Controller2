# Embedded-Controller 2
<b>Short description:</b><br/>
In this project I want to work with Embedded-Controller 2. part, where it's a bit more advanced. I have a case that is about an office environment. In the office 
I need to write out which office the Controller is placed, I need to get an accurate tempature the office has. If the office is too cold I was thinking of 
a blue diode will turn on and a message will be shown on the touchscreen saying, the office is to cold. If the room is too hot a buzzer plays a sound and a red 
diode will light up with a text saying the room is too hot.
